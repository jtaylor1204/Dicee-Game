## Features

- There are two die labled "player 1" and "player 2"; play against the computer or play with a friend!

- Refresh the screen to "roll" the die again and again!

- Click the "instructions" tab to view game instructions

- Use this to settle arguments, assign chores, make a decision - the possibilities are endless!


## Bugs/Updates to be made - I am always open to comments and guidance on how to solve these!

- [ ] Add more React components to stop instructions from rendering on screen load
